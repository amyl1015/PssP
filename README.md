I tried using python3 on my venv to run the code. However, this was unsuccesful because it kept giving me the following error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'MySQLdb'. I tried resolving the issue by installing the package using pip3, but, that did not work. 

I tried using python2 on my local machine to run the code. However, I could not test to see if this option works because the flask_sqlalchemy package cannot be found and I cannot install it with pip.
